0
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,000
Someone who crosses the sea?
on a speed boat to Spain,?


1
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,240
running away from poverty,?
is exposed to anything.?


2
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,160
There were ten of us on the boat.?


3
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,080
We were four days at sea.?


4
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,440
I was very nervous?
and feared for our lives.?


5
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,200
Sea rescue team, we have
the position of a boat.


6
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,400
-South to southwest. 35 50.
-Roger that. Thanks.


7
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,880
The motor worked, but?
there wasn't enough gas to get to Spain.?


8
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
The wind was blowing against us?
and pushed in the opposite direction?


9
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,720
and we ran out of bottles?
of gasoline.?


10
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,800
When we stopped,?
we had no clue where we were,?


11
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,360
if in Spain or not.?


12
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,760
I only thought about dying.?


13
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,000
Continue searching, starting
with the island of Alborán.


14
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,720
I thought I wouldn't get out alive.?


15
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:05,400
Four days of hunger and thirst.?
I could see death before me.?


16
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:16,520
We saw a chance to survive?
when we saw the patrol ship.?


17
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,840
-What's their position?
-They are not moving.


18
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,360
It's a pneumatic boat,
about six or seven metres.


19
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,880
First, a small plane arrived,?
keeping its distance from us.?


20
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,240
It flew watching over us.?


21
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,560
Then came the police helicopter.?


22
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,280
It was still and taking photos.?
Then came a boat to save us.?


23
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,880
Sea rescue team, do you have
a visual of the boat?


24
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,120
-There it is.
-Right at the bow.


25
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,720
I left Morocco?
to have a future.?


26
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,600
I want my own family,?
to have kids,?


27
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,800
open a barber shop,?
have a house, like anyone else.?


28
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,320
God saved us.?


29
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,760
C'mon! C'mon!


30
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,200
C'mon! Let's go!


31
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,800
It's alright!


32
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,520
Europe is considered
the land of hope and light,


33
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,320
where everything is easy
and nothing is impossible.


34
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,440
Many still see it that way,


35
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,280
despite everything they say
in the news about the crisis.


36
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
People don't believe it.


37
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,160
I'm another victim of life.


38
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,440
Because of my parents
or whoever,


39
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,720
I was born in Morocco and now
I suffer the consequences.


40
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,360
I wanted a new reality.


41
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
I thought it was unfair


42
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,800
and the power to change
was in my own hands.


43
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,440
When I was 10, I thought
about my future:


44
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,760
I quit school
and started working,


45
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,400
which makes you
grow up very fast.


46
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,840
You earn five euro,


47
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,720
which is almost
50 dirhams for a week,


48
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,560
which gets you nowhere.


49
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,200
One day I said "Enough.
I need to leave this place".


50
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,040
They come from Maghreb
or Sub-Saharan Africa,


51
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,000
are minors and travel alone
risking their lives in the dessert,


52
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,120
on a speed boat,
or hidden in a truck.


53
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,080
If they are lucky,
they'll reach the promise land


54
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,160
and live in juvenile centres,
until they reach legal age.


55
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,480
That day, on their 18th birthday,


56
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,800
they say goodbye,


57
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,280
more alone and vulnerable
than when they arrived.


58
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,280
18 YEARS AND A DAY


59
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,480
On their birthday,
in most of the cases,


60
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,120
they are left in the streets.


61
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,720
They are left forced
to live like adults


62
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,480
without any resources


63
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,480
and, in most cases,


64
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,440
without a place to live
arranged beforehand.


65
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,880
Most end up calling
the Social Services


66
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,440
to get a place to sleep
in any of the homeless centres


67
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
in the different
autonomous regions.


68
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,040
My name is Redouane,


69
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
I was born in Tetouan


70
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,160
on the 12 of January of 2000.


71
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
When I was in the youth centre,
I was turning 18 soon.


72
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,320
They don't help you
if you are about to turn 18.


73
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,600
They don't do anything.


74
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,120
On my birthday,
they told me I had to go.


75
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,640
I know I had to leave,


76
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,040
but I need help.
I have no family here.


77
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,640
They tell you to leave
or they'll call Social Services.


78
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I told them to call, because
I don't have where to sleep.


79
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,040
Most of the time
they see the case as...


80
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,520
There's the door.
Go figure it out.


81
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,760
The social services


82
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,840
of Samur Social
in Madrid tell us


83
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,560
that we can't take someone


84
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
who just turned 18


85
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,480
and slept the night before
in a youth centre,


86
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,400
because it's not
a case of emergency.


87
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,160
It should be anticipated.


88
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Appropriate accommodation
should be foreseen.


89
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,360
On my birthday,
I slept in a garage.


90
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,640
A garage with drunk people.


91
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,640
I didn't have a bed,
but a hard chair.


92
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,080
That's where we slept.


93
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,520
The dreams I had in Morocco


94
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,600
didn't come true
when I arrived here.


95
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Life is difficult.


96
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,280
In the Raíces Foundation,


97
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,200
which works
for young people's rights,


98
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,000
we meet Ayoub.


99
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,760
He needs help, as the police
have given him a deportation order.


100
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
What's worse than turning 18
and being on the street


101
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,480
is leaving the centre
without a legalised status.


102
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,680
They wouldn't help me.?
For the five months?


103
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,160
I was there,?
all they said were lies.?


104
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,680
I would ask the Director?
if they processed my application?


105
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
and only gave excuses.?


106
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,480
She would tell me?
they'd do it next week?


107
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,360
and the same thing?
until I turned 18.?


108
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,000
Then, they told me?
I had to leave.?


109
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,320
Ayoub spent five months
in this centre in Viznar, Granada,


110
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,640
opened in 2017
as an emergency centre


111
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,600
to accommodate huge
amounts of young foreigners.


112
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,440
They gave him a roof,
food, and a bed,


113
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,560
but threw him to the streets
without a residence permit,


114
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,000
making him an adult
with an illegal status.


115
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,360
Of course, without a tutor


116
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,880
they won't process
the residence permit


117
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,640
and, in most cases,
there won't even be


118
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,160
a process for documentation,


119
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,240
they won't contact
the due embassy or consulate


120
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,320
to get the official
documentation of the children,


121
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,360
leaving them in
an illegal situation


122
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,200
caused by
the Spanish administration.


123
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,000
According to state data,


124
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,840
within the first nine months
of 2018, in Spain, there were


125
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,360
almost 5,000 immigrant children


126
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,320
and residence permits
were being processed


127
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,920
for only 8% of them.


128
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,360
More than have of them
come into Spain


129
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,400
through the southern coast.


130
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,800
I admit that sometimes
it's impossible to get it,


131
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,800
especially if the minor


132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,720
turns 18 in three months.
We can't help much.


133
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,920
Luckily, and I speak
in the case of Málaga,


134
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,280
those cases are
very few.


135
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,800
In our case,


136
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,880
we have levels of priority


137
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,040
for those who are about
to reach legal age,


138
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
and we can't wait,


139
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,840
so we can go ahead
and file a case of homelessness.


140
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,480
But, if they come in
short months away from 18


141
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,800
and the due consulate
doesn't help,


142
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
it's very hard.


143
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,840
Málaga is not only
packed with young immigrants


144
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,160
that leave youth centres
under the provincial care.


145
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
They come from all over Andalusia


146
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
and, in some cases,
from Ceuta and Melilla,


147
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,560
as they know the city


148
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,400
holds a facility
to host homeless people,


149
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,320
created by the Town Hall
and 10 social entities.


150
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,680
It's called Puerta Única


151
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,360
and has a specific protocol
for such youngsters.


152
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,720
Five years ago we identify


153
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,600
a new profile of youngsters
between 18 and 20


154
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,160
that invade housing
in the city centre.


155
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,080
When the police finds them,


156
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,840
we see that
they are usually Moroccan,


157
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,640
very young, that's true,
without schooling,


158
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,200
without any form
of legal papers,


159
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,040
and, mostly, without speaking Spanish.


160
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,760
We start working with them


161
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,040
and learn they were
released from centres


162
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,000
or other youth units
of the government of Andalusia,


163
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
but no one informed us.


164
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Andalusia gives them,
literally, 20 euro


165
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,880
and when they turn 18
they let them out the centre


166
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,880
without any type of
care system.


167
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,800
These kids,
more than vulnerable,


168
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,760
are in the lowest level
of social exclusion.


169
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,440
When you are illegal,
don't speak the language,


170
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,560
don't have any money
or any education,


171
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,240
don't have where to sleep,


172
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,000
it's the lowest level
of social exclusion.


173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,920
I arrived to Melilla
and was living on the street.


174
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,440
I know people
who sleep here,


175
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
homeless people
that sleep here.


176
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,320
A boy who leaves the centre
and turns 18 years old,


177
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,640
without documentation or anything.


178
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,720
People who come on a boat
from Melilla, Ceuta, or Morocco


179
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,800
come here to sleep.


180
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,400
There are two mattresses
and a roof on top.


181
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,160
I found the bed
in the rubbish and brought it here,


182
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
making myself a hut.


183
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,480
This is the roof,
with wood and cardboard.


184
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,280
The plastic stops the rain


185
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,480
so it doesn't get wet.


186
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,320
In summer you don't need
the plastic cover,


187
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,920
but in winter, the rain
and the cold gets in.


188
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,040
Abdelali is a young man
who was in Melilla,


189
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,320
where he turned 18


190
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,760
and, he was released
without documentation


191
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,640
due to administration problems,


192
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,520
making him live on the street
for 10 more months,


193
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,440
until he was able
to get his permit.


194
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,520
Given that its retroactive,


195
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
when he acquired
his residence permit,


196
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,920
he only had two months
to renew the permit.


197
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,840
That's when he goes to Málaga


198
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,880
entering the system
for homeless people.


199
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,000
First and foremost,


200
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,640
they must find a place
in the local shelter


201
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
of San Juan de Dios


202
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,520
or the apartments
Puerta Única has


203
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,240
to keep them away
from the streets and danger.


204
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,680
Drugs are a big danger,
as can be prostitution.


205
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,400
It's easy to think
they don't fit in or adjust,


206
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,800
but you see it differently
from their perspective.


207
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,840
Integration is not easy.


208
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,200
Without the right tools,
it's not easy.


209
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,080
They can't do it alone.
The system is vital,


210
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,000
and the system doesn't protect them.


211
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,360
The system has isolated them.


212
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,040
The new guys


213
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,160
usually sleep under bridges
here in Málaga


214
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,080
or squatting houses,


215
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,800
while in summer
they stay near the beach.


216
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
Puerta Única has
a mobile unit


217
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,720
that goes around the city
365 days a year


218
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,080
to offer homeless people


219
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,680
the resources of the unit
in Málaga.


220
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,800
Exceptionally, Nordin
takes us around


221
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,160
to see if there are
young immigrants in the street.


222
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,040
Many times,


223
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,320
we can find, in this case,
boys sleeping in the street,


224
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
an we invade their space.


225
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,520
It's key to respect them
and to ask for permission:


226
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,080
to sit down with them,
boy or girl...


227
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,120
These are key skills
to develop.


228
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,320
Let's try the port.
I'm not sure if they're there,


229
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,040
but we'll give it a shot.


230
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
They usually stay
under that bridge,


231
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,720
the one who are new here.


232
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,920
It has rained
the last couple of days,


233
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,200
and the water has risen,
so we can't see them.


234
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,880
There is someone there,


235
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,400
but it looks like
a man with his boat.


236
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,920
That's his house. All he has.


237
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,200
There's an imaginary door
to enter his house.


238
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,680
These kids tell you
about themselves, their stories,


239
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
how they got here,
why they came.


240
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,520
It's important to know why


241
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
because there's always a story.


242
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,120
None want to become
18 in the centres of Ceuta and Melilla,


243
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,040
and they run away
by boat or in a truck


244
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,080
to take them to the peninsula.


245
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,000
They prefer risking their lives
before living in a youth centre


246
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,600
where violence is common
and life stands still.


247
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,080
Some of them,
not to say everyone,


248
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,400
take advantage over the new guys.


249
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,680
If they arrive with clothes,
money, they can...


250
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,640
They can and they will
take it away from them.


251
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,200
It's like the jungle in there.


252
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,240
The strong against the weak.


253
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,480
Days and weeks go by


254
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,280
and you see that
nothing has changed:


255
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,160
same routine, the same circle
over and over again.


256
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,000
Your life is meaningless
and nothing changes,


257
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,440
so you have to look for
an opportunity,


258
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,680
the dream I had
since I was a boy.


259
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,680
On the 26 of January, 2014,
a date I'll never forget,


260
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,600
I went with a friend,
at around 7 or 8 am


261
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
to jump the port's fence.


262
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,600
We took advantage
of the rain,


263
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,400
when police were letting
all the trucks go by.


264
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,520
We sneaked in to
a container in a truck.


265
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,840
The policeman verifying
everything said it was OK


266
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,480
and closed the container.


267
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,240
I had a mixed feeling
of happiness and fear.


268
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,920
Fear that we rightfully had
as the container was of iron


269
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
and steel, with no way
to get out.


270
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,760
The air conditioning was on,


271
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,040
but for the 45 minutes
between Ceuta and Algeciras


272
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,760
we were very cold.


273
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,040
When we got to Algeciras,


274
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,640
the police let all the trucks
at customs go by, except ours.


275
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,640
They opened it
while we were inside.


276
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,920
We didn't speak Spanish


277
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,480
but they tried
to explain that


278
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,880
the container would have
been closed for 23 hours


279
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,560
without opening it.


280
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,200
We were very lucky.


281
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,520
It takes courage to be 18,


282
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,560
sleep in a shelter,
and not lose hope.


283
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,120
Redouane does it every morning


284
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,160
by attending a social
integration course in carpentry


285
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,760
taught by the Cultural Association
La Kalle in Madrid.


286
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,520
We have looked for
different accommodation options


287
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,640
for young immigrants
between 18 and 21 years old,


288
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,760
but there are more people
than there are openings.


289
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,200
The shelter usually hosts
homeless people,


290
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,920
people with addictions,


291
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,000
and other situations
some people go through.


292
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,120
They have live it for 10 months.


293
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,840
In their case, it's hard
to do things right, be patient,


294
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,240
wait for an opening,
fulfil objectives,


295
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,840
follow the rules,
that daily struggle.


296
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,600
This young man
is like any other of his age


297
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,360
when it comes to his start
in the professional world.


298
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,400
I live in a shelter,
but I don't sleep well there.


299
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,720
Each morning I try
my best t go to the course.


300
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,840
I want a good job,
as a carpenter or a mechanic,


301
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,120
and work all year


302
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,040
to earn enough money to live


303
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,280
and send some money
to my family.


304
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,200
It's not an easy goal
considering his permit,


305
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,200
as for everyone, is temporary
and doesn't allow him to work.


306
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,680
To change his status,
a company must offer


307
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,000
an annual contract
for a full-time job.


308
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,040
Not a simple thing
for nationals either.


309
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,520
Each night, Redouane
goes back to the shelter


310
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,280
counting down they days
left to renew his documentation.


311
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,000
The same administration


312
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,800
that doesn't let him work,


313
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,040
demands him to prove
how he makes a living


314
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,800
to avoid his deportation.


315
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,560
The system treats you
like yoghurt or a carton of milk.


316
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,400
When you reach legal age,
you are expired


317
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,840
and useless.


318
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,440
Someone who turns 18,
reaching legal age,


319
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,120
is given documentation
without a work permit,


320
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,160
forcing you to steal
and commit other crimes.


321
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,760
In Málaga, Puerta Única designed


322
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
a system that does more


323
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,560
than give them
a place to sleep.


324
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,160
They help with paperwork,
teach them Spanish,


325
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,720
push them
to go back to school,


326
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,040
provide courses
to enter the work force,


327
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,840
and open the doors
to the professional world.


328
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,680
When we talk about
the young men who come,


329
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,240
it's important they know
they start a migration process


330
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,680
high on hopes, but also
with the possible failure.


331
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,560
They leave their countries,


332
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,600
losing their relationships
with family,


333
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,520
making it across the border...


334
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,800
they know people
who don't make it across


335
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,240
and lose those friends too.


336
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,000
When they turn 18
and think life is about to start,


337
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,080
they find themselves
in a situation of homelessness,


338
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,680
in a difficult situation.
Feeling they were wrong.


339
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,800
The permit they're given
doesn't allow them to work


340
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,840
and unemployment is high,


341
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,400
and they don't have
a competitive profile


342
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,360
compared to others.


343
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:13,120
You have to take advantage
of this apartment, you know?


344
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,320
It's as easy to lose it
as to get it. No more games.


345
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
I don't like playing games.


346
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,720
Well, you know games
are always around the corner.


347
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,440
You have to take
this opportunity now.


348
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,400
It's your last chance.
Now or never.


349
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,920
Do you need anything
for the house?


350
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,160
Last time you told me
about the pans, but...


351
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,160
Yes, we need frying pans.


352
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,560
Living in a flat means
independence, freedom, calm,


353
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,280
and is the most wanted resource


354
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,120
as well as the biggest commitment
to follow the rules.


355
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,680
Puerta Única has 37
sports in the city,


356
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,560
while the local government
has another 15,


357
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,440
but they aren't enough.


358
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,760
How are the neighbours?
Have you had any problems?


359
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,520
No problems. We don't
have problems with anyone.


360
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,080
Everything is going well.


361
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,720
I just ask


362
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,840
because those who have been
here a while are fine,


363
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,800
but the new ones,


364
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,720
I need to make sure
everything is OK.


365
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,760
Málaga Acoge works
towards emancipation projects.


366
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,800
Bear in mind that the kids
have been living under care,


367
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,920
with strict schedules
and decisions made for them.


368
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,360
When they start working,


369
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,360
it's about managing
their own independence.


370
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,880
We try to help
these young men


371
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,280
in every step
of their emancipation,


372
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,840
as a guidance, without making
decisions for them.


373
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,520
You are old enough
to be responsible.


374
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,520
You're not a kid anymore
and know what to do.


375
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,000
It's time to...


376
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Being responsible
in the kitchen isn't easy.


377
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm a cook now.


378
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,000
We look at the boys'
training, to try to find


379
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,720
a way of exploiting that,
studying the markets


380
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,920
and different opportunities
in Málaga.


381
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,320
It's usually in services,
tourism and so on,


382
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
in companies
we collaborate with,


383
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,680
which are more than 200,


384
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,240
that help us work
with young immigrants,


385
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,360
and help in their
professional futures.


386
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,120
Today we are going
to make tortilla de patata.


387
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,800
Besides the paella, it's
the most common dish


388
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,160
in Spain.


389
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,080
We will need potatoes,
of course, eggs,


390
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
oil, of what kind?


391
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,920
extra virgin olive oil,
very good. Exactly.


392
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,520
Salt and onion,
which is optional.


393
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,480
They come here
very enthusiastic


394
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,600
and you can tell
they want to make a new life


395
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,840
with a new prospect
for their future


396
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,320
they probably won't have
in their own country.


397
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,360
You all know how to cut
and cook the ingredients?


398
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Let's get to it!
We're here to cook.


399
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,400
We are here to guide them
and motivate them,


400
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,040
as well as tell them
they have a bright future


401
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,160
that will depend on
their will to work.


402
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,680
Curl your fingers inwards.


403
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,120
Slowly, slowly.
I don't want it fast,


404
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,480
just good technique.
You'll get faster in time.


405
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,600
I want to learn to cook.
I think I'm good


406
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,360
and, if I'm lucky,
I can find a job.


407
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,520
That will, God willing,
help me get a start,


408
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,320
but it's not easy.


409
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,560
A job can open many doors


410
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,440
because it helps you
meet different people


411
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,000
and learn many things
about life.


412
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,880
It requires patience,


413
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,120
and patience is
the mother of science.


414
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,000
It's very important.


415
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,280
We will mix this
with the potato


416
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,360
and then season it
in the mix to then fry it.


417
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,920
I give them more to do
as I see their progress,


418
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,480
to simulate a situation
as close and similar


419
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,000
to what they can experience
in a real professional kitchen.


420
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,040
There's a misconception about this.


421
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,640
Many think we are just
a pit stop.


422
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,120
Many do go on
to live in Madrid,


423
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,840
or Bilbao and Catalonia,
it's true.


424
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,120
But, the percentage
that leaves is 20%.


425
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,400
If we do the math,
considering real numbers,


426
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,080
to this day
two hundred leave


427
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,000
and eight hundred stay.


428
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,400
They will still be immigrants.


429
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,880
The programme for young adults
of the government of Andalusia


430
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,680
provides these young men
with apartments


431
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,280
and other sources
of so-called "partial degree"


432
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,440
to help these boys
prepare for adulthood


433
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,800
while they are still
under the protection system.


434
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,440
I was studying,


435
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,840
but I didn't like school
in my country, Morocco,


436
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,800
so, I decided to come here.


437
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,160
I went to the harbour,


438
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,120
spent five months
on the streets,


439
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,640
until I hid under a truck
that brought me to Spain.


440
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,120
When I got here,
the police found me


441
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,360
and put me in
a youth centre.


442
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,720
Hamid is in a professional course
for construction and production.


443
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,600
He is one of the 1,300 users
of the Labora programme,


444
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,000
half of which are
young immigrants.


445
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,840
When they come to us,


446
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,360
we work on all their skills:


447
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,720
their personal and social skills,


448
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,400
as well their professional ones,


449
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,760
to help them develop
an independent future.


450
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,440
Things like professional
training, social skills,


451
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,040
how to open a bank account,


452
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,480
how a leasing contract
of a flat works, or even


453
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,560
how to deal
with a job interview.


454
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,160
Ideally, they would come
as soon as they are 16,


455
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,840
to give us two years
to be there for support


456
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,800
before they reach
the legal age in Spain.


457
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,560
I would like to live in Seville


458
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,840
and work in something
I love to do,


459
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,320
like electromechanics.


460
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,040
I want to help my family,
as they got me here,


461
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,000
and do it for myself.
I want to get far in life


462
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,000
and be able to travel.
I'll travel around the world.


463
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,840
The work we do
in the Labora programme


464
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,000
for a local kid is different
than for an immigrant.


465
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,520
A Spanish kid is difficult
to teach the dynamics


466
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,560
of being independent,
earning their own money,


467
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,680
while one of these boys
already has that sense of life


468
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,400
and wants to start working
as soon as they can.


469
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,480
At the end of the year,


470
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,120
only seven of every ten young
immigrants looking for work


471
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,000
is able to sign a contract.


472
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,640
The problem comes
for those who don't have resources


473
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,240
and leave the system at 18,
without professional training,


474
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,160
without a school diploma and,
sometimes, without the language.


475
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,440
They have a clear goal,
which is to work.


476
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,520
When they get here,
they learn that work


477
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,080
is attached to training,
which is key.


478
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,040
Getting a high school diploma


479
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,600
means being an individual,


480
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,240
which is the lowest degree
in society, as we know it.


481
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,680
They need it more
than their classmates


482
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,040
because they are in
a lower social situation,


483
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,600
which is unquestionable.


484
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,880
We mentioned the pharynx
and the oesophagus.


485
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,040
Where is the oesophagus?


486
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,760
He pulled his zipper down.


487
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,840
It's a tube.


488
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,480
-Where does the tube go?
-To the stomach.


489
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,160
Some of them
sleep in a car


490
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,680
and others sleep on a sofa


491
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,080
an NGO can lend them,


492
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
as there aren't enough
resources for everyone.


493
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,240
Keeping calm
and being constant,


494
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,480
to come to class
every day is not easy.


495
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,920
It's very difficult
and requires work.


496
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,000
Málaga Acoge aims
to provide high school degrees


497
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,880
for those who chose
to stay in Spain.


498
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,760
Of the 18 immigrants


499
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,360
studying in this
school of Vicente Espinel,


500
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,200
only a third of them
will go on to finish school.


501
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,280
Food is broken down
with our teeth.


502
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,160
The tongue and saliva...


503
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,480
Do you know what
broken down means?


504
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,640
-How is it in your language?
-"Broken down" in arab?


505
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,400
-In arab?
-Yes, how do you say it in arab?


506
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,800
-You won't understand.
-I know I won't.


507
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
The issue is for them
to understand


508
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
the importance of studies.


509
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,400
We must support them,
be on top of them,


510
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,760
sometimes act
as if we were


511
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,560
the students' parents,


512
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,840
or tell them off,
make them cry, hug them...


513
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,560
Only then will
the problem be solved.


514
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,480
Right now,
I'm studying in school.


515
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,320
I have learnt a lot
from being in school.


516
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,200
My teacher, Yolanda,
is a really nice person.


517
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,240
She is great, really incredible.


518
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I'll get my school degree
and after I do,


519
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,640
I'll look for a job.
It helps to have a diploma,


520
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
and easier. Much better.


521
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,360
I'll find a good job
and earn money


522
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,240
to buy a house and a car,


523
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,400
have my own family
and kids. Who knows?


524
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,280
Sometimes I cry when
I think about my family.


525
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,160
They are far away
and I feel very, very sad.


526
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,920
They tell me to keep going
and to not look back,


527
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,000
to stay away from
the bad ways of life.


528
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,880
If you get into drugs,
your future is gone


529
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,520
and you'll find
yourself on the streets.


530
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,600
You have to walk
firmly in life.


531
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,240
There are many ways
to come to Spain.


532
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,600
For example, you can
arrive with papers in order,


533
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,400
but you have to pay for it.


534
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,520
I don't have money
to pay 3,000 euro.


535
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,760
Another way to come
is by crossing the border,


536
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,000
for which you pay
at least 500 euro,


537
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,640
or you can come in
through Melilla or Ceuta.


538
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,480
I was in the street in Melilla.


539
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,120
Living on the street
means being cold,


540
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,040
being hungry and
going through other things


541
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,920
that is not easy
for everyone.


542
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,240
When he turned 18,


543
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,000
Abdesalam had made
the firm decision


544
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,440
to get it together and study.


545
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,640
Upon leaving the protection
system, he left for Málaga.


546
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,080
Puerta Única offered him
a cooking class that changed his life.


547
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,280
-We have an order for a salad.
-Coming up.


548
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,360
I did a course to be
assistant cook


549
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,240
for three months with
Málaga Acoge. It was great.


550
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,880
I then did my internship here,


551
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,840
where they have hired me
and where I work.


552
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I'm learning little by little
and have been here seven months.


553
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,320
All my colleagues,
the waiters,


554
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,800
maintenance staff, cooks,
are all really nice.


555
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,520
Thanks to the Incorpora programme,
financed by the La Caixa foundation,


556
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,080
as well as the businesses
that support these young men,


557
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,840
the fear caused by illegality
and exclusion fades away.


558
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,800
He now has the
annual contract he needed


559
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,440
to get his work permit.


560
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,120
I never used to like it,


561
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,200
but since I'm here,
I like cooking.


562
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,120
There are more jobs
as cooks in Spain.


563
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,280
Our experience has shown


564
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,320
that most young men
who enjoy resources and our time


565
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,000
can be independent
and live autonomously.


566
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,440
They go on to be
independent, have jobs,


567
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,200
pay their social security


568
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,120
and their taxes, rent,


569
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,480
and lead completely
normal lives,


570
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,520
like any other citizen.


571
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,840
My name is Lamin Keita.


572
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,600
I'm from Guinea Conakry


573
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,320
and I'm 17 years old.


574
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,080
I had always worked with my father


575
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,600
back in my country.


576
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,560
My relies a lot on me


577
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,280
because I helped him a lot.


578
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,640
I wanted to study.
Really wanted to study,


579
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,600
but my father...
he insisted a lot,


580
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
so I couldn't do anything.


581
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,240
Africa and Europe are different.


582
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,680
Very different. In Africa


583
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:06,160
you can't make your own
decisions without your father.


584
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,280
Lamin left a life
he no longer wanted


585
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,000
and, at 15, went on


586
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,880
one of the most dangerous
migratory journeys.


587
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,640
This path takes West Africans
through Bamako,


588
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,080
the capital of Mali, to the sea
and across the Saharan desert.


589
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,840
They asked for money,


590
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,640
saying they would take me
to Algeria, to the its capital.


591
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,600
I agreed and said OK
because I didn't know.


592
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,000
I didn't know if
they wanted to trick me.


593
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,240
We spent three days on a bus,


594
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,640
until we got to a city
of Mali called Gao that's at war.


595
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,480
They told us
we had to pay more money


596
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,200
and give them money
to get on a truck


597
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,480
that would take us there. A big truck


598
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,120
with more than 200 people or so.


599
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,840
Gao is the doorstep to the desert.


600
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,200
There, human traffickers


601
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,800
have the absolute power


602
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,840
before entering the land
of endless sand dunes.


603
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,120
They called the truck driver


604
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,160
because they know we have money.


605
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,640
They told me that
I had to pay to go through.


606
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,320
I was very young.
The youngest one there.


607
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,080
I had to pay money,
but I said I didn't have any.


608
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,560
I was crying and they left me.


609
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,240
It was a two-week trip
in the truck with nothing.


610
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,800
There's no food in the desert


611
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,280
and nowhere to buy food.


612
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,640
Lamin's trip is long,
stopping in different towns.


613
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,720
He worked, paid the mafias,
and continued his journey


614
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,480
making his way north.


615
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,800
I will not go back empty handed
without being able to help my mom.


616
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,520
I would rather die


617
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,000
than return with shame to my country.


618
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,040
Lamin is 17 now and should be
in a protection centre,


619
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,920
but lives in a flat for adults
provided by Pueblos Unidos.


620
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,520
Despite his documentation
stating he is a minor,


621
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,240
Spanish administration
considers Lamin an adult.


622
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,680
Two weeks


623
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,640
into his arrival to this
protection shelter in Madrid,


624
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,920
he did test to determine his age,


625
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,400
concluding he was more
than 18 years old,


626
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,840
making the judge sign off
a decree for his legal age.


627
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,280
I cried and didn't say anything.


628
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,400
My lawyer said, "Lamin,
do you want to do the test?"


629
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,200
He said I had to do
a full physical test.


630
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,360
I told him I would.
The judge also asked


631
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,720
"Do you want to do the test?"


632
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,920
I said I preferred doing it.


633
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,880
If my documentation don't come,
I preferred doing the test.


634
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,040
I did the test and they said
I was 18 years old


635
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,760
and that I had to leave.


636
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,400
The Raíces Foundation
claims such age exams


637
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,840
are done systematically
to children


638
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,720
from Sub-Saharan Africa,
Morocco, or Algeria.


639
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,560
It usually includes
an x-ray of the wrist,


640
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,560
of the mouth
and a full physical.


641
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,920
They take all my clothes off
and the woman was looking.


642
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,120
In our religion,
this is not good.


643
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,160
It is not allowed
for a woman to stand


644
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,080
and look at a naked man,
staring like that.


645
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,640
They did it to me
and I accepted it.


646
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,200
In some regions,
like Andalusia, tests


647
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,440
are limited to
x-rays of the wrist.


648
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,000
The margin of error
to determine


649
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,040
their age increases.


650
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,440
It is a test with
a high margin of error,


651
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
with a two-year variation.


652
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,400
Therefore, we must apply
the margin of error.


653
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,560
That is, if a doctor
or a radiologist


654
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,920
determines he is 19,
two years up or down,


655
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,240
the range is interpreted
to favour the minor


656
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,360
and establish
he is 17 years old.


657
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,000
In theory, the exam
must only be done


658
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,400
when the minor's age
and physical appearance


659
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,320
are clearly contradictory
and when the court,


660
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,840
the only authority
that can decree


661
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,560
if the person is a minor or not,
believes he is undocumented.


662
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,440
We want those
considered minors


663
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,120
to be in fact minors
and not adults


664
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,480
who try
to come in as a minor,


665
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,200
using as only proof
any documentation


666
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,320
that, in most cases,
can have errors.


667
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,400
In 2018, the Committee for
the Rights of the Child


668
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,400
was particularly
strict on Spain,


669
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,240
claiming the use of
invasive test to determine age,


670
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
despite being documented,


671
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,200
and the high exposure of risk
in the case of an error.


672
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,320
What does this mean?


673
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
The child is left on the streets,


674
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,640
with a decree that says
he is of legal age


675
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,680
and a passport that says
he is still a minor.


676
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,800
A valid passport, at that,


677
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,320
used by the other
Spanish administrations.


678
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,160
So, they can't apply
for a work permit


679
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,920
without a residence permit,


680
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,320
nor apply for
a residence permit


681
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,440
since they don't have
legal guardianship.


682
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,520
With that, they can't apply.


683
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,040
They can't get medical care,


684
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,000
they can't register, they can't
get a medical service card...


685
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,840
Strangely enough, that little
boy or girl, holding a passport


686
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,160
that says they are a minor,
can't even be deported.


687
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,040
They are doomed to live
in Spain in the street


688
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,680
until they turn 18,
according to their passport,


689
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,160
the same passport the judged
ruled to be invalid.


690
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,200
Lamin works four months in Algiers


691
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,520
to pay for the last part of his trip.


692
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,920
The goal is to reach Castillejos,


693
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,320
a Moroccan city


694
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,200
where those who can't pay
to cross the border by sea


695
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,800
get ready to jump
the fence in Ceuta.


696
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,840
There was a lot of people.
Almost 700 or so.


697
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,480
We tried to get in.
I was at the front.


698
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,520
They won't hit
the children,


699
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,000
so the young ones
are always at the front


700
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,440
to climb the fence.


701
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,720
We opened the door
with a hammer,


702
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,200
while others are jumping
over the fence.


703
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,280
Others tried to break
the door and the locks.


704
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,640
No one wants to go back.


705
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,920
Everyone was determined
to get across the get.


706
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,360
There was no other option.


707
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,880
We opened the first door,
reached the second one


708
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,160
and crossed running.
I was at the front in the video.


709
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,920
Some people cried


710
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:19,040
because they
had suffered a lot.


711
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,440
I left my country sure


712
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,920
that I wouldn't come back


713
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,320
without...


714
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,600
without having a new life.
